            Outside of coding, I spend my time across a few favorite hobbies. I
            am very physically active, which generally includes bodybuilding,
            yoga, and volleyball through the Gotham Volleyball organization. I
            love video games and host game nights with friends regularly. I
            enjoy bringing good people together! I really like Broadway shows,
            both plays and musicals. I'm also interested in doing work to better
            the planet. I'm environmentally conscious and vegan.
